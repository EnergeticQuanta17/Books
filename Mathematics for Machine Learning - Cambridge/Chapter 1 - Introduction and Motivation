Machine Learning --> designing algorithms -> automatically extract valuable information/patterns
	General purpose methodologies

	Data
	Model
	Learning

A model is said to learn from data if its performance on a given task improves after the data is taken into account.
	Generalize well to unseen data

	Learning --> finding patterns and structure in data by optimizing parameters of model

Understanding Math Principles enables
	Creating new Machine Learning solutions
	Understanding and Debugging
	Inherent assumptions and limitations of methodologies
