Cpython --> interface with C code and pass information from the C program to Python and vice versa. This allows to use legacy code(e.g. FFTW)

Scipy and numpy makes integrating legacy code easy

The term broadcasting describes how numpy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations

Masking of elements in an array if we want to remove some elements (rather than creating a new array)

Numpy --> ODE, special functions, optimizations, integration
