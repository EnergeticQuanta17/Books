The natural phenomenon of recursion prevades many areas of mathematics.

3.1 Recurrence Relations
	Bottom-Up
		1 to 5

	Top-Down
		5 to 1

	A well-defined recurrence relation needs a nonrecursive base case that gives at least one value of the function explicitly

Pg 145 --> Why only hexagons?? HMMM
	It has an increase decrease pattern

	Encoder-Decoder?

Example 3.4
	Hexagon --> H(n) will have n hexagons on each edge
		But 1 overlap at every vertex will happpen
		Hence 6n-6
			6 --> edges, n --> n hexagons on each edge, 6 --> overlap

Built on previous layers

Example 3.5
	Number of elements in powerset 

Example 3.6
	Number of nodes in complete binary tree

Example 3.7
	Number of edges in complete graph

To show:- R(n) = f(n)
	R(n) = f(n-1) + n_part_of_eqn
	R(n) = f(n)


Mathematical Induction is a difficult topic.
	WHY?

	This section only discussed a narrow view of the subjet; verifying a closed-form solution

Failure to find a counterexample to a statement does not mean that the statement is true.

What is "line map" ?
	And think about its recursive definition

Recursive Geometry
	Limit of a recursive function
		limit of an example recursive series is 1

	Similarly, we can consider the limit of a recursive definition of a geometric patterns.
	This is one way to construct fractals, a special type of shape with infinite layers of self=similarity.

	Example 3.23
		Start with equilateral triangle
		Pull the middle of each edge to make a triangle
		Limit is a fractal known as Koch Snowflake

	Exercises 3.24
		Fractal model for the Badda-Bing axiomatic system

	Mathematical study of Fractals is relatively new
		2nd half of 20th century
		using computers

		FRACTALS ARE THE KEY TO SOLVING THE 3n+1 problem -- MARK MY WORDS
