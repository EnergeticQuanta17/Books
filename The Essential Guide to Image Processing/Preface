	X-ray in multiple angles

Astronomers
	Astronomers	are known by "in what wavelength they specialize":
		Radio Astronomers
		X-ray Astronomers

Non-EM radiation is also useful for imaging
	Ultrasound to create images of the human body
	Low-frequency sound waves --> create images of the earth's subsurface

Source --> Interacts with material --> Transduced to electric signal --> Digitalized

Can be used to extract information about the radiation source and/or about the objects with which the radiation interacts

Reflection Images
	Radar Images
	Sonar Images
	Laser Images
	Some types of Electro Microscopic Images

Emission Images
	Self-luminous

	Thermal or infrared Images

	The information to be had --> often primarily internal to the  object

	The image may reveal how the object creates radiations and hence something of the internal strucutre of the object being imaged.

	However, it may also be external --> e.g. thermal camera

Absorption Images
	Yield information about the internal strucuture of the object

	Radiation is partially aborbed or attenuated sensed radiation in the recorded image

Range of camera --> 10**(-10) to 10**30
	"Find out why is is easier for telescope than microscope"

		40 orders of magnitude

	Techniques are applicable to any scale

Multi-Scale concept
	Eg:- Coins --> Spiral
		Small scale --> Larger scale
