Analytic Combinations --> quantitative predictions of 
	"properties" of large structured combinatorial structures

Essential for Analysis of Algorithms
and the study of scientific models
	Probability Theory
	Statistical Physics
	Computational Biology
	Information theory

Symbolic enumeration methods
Complex Analysis
Generating Functions

Above topics can be applied on
	permutations
	sequences
	strings
	walks
	paths
	trees
	graphs
	maps
	planar configurations
	and so on

Generative functions are central objects of study of the theory.

Generating functions --> viewed as "Analytic Objects" --> mapping from complex plane to itself

Suitable adaptation of methods also opens the way to quantitative analysis of characteristic parameters of large structures via a perturbational approach

Approach provided by Analytic Combinatorics can we viewed as an "operational calculus"
	Three concepts:-
	1. Symbolic Methods --> encode counting sequences
	2. Complex Asymptotics --> can extract asymtotic counting information from generating functions
	3. Random Structures --> Probabilistic properties of large random structures
		deformation = adding auxially variable
		perturbation = examining the effect of small variations of such uxially craiabls
