Singularities -> (ix)

Approach provided by Analytic Combinatorics can we viewed as an "operational calculus"
	Three concepts:-
	1. Symbolic Methods
	2. Complex Asymptotics
		Singularities appear to be a key determinant of ssymptotic behavior
	3. Random Structures

	What are those 3 in this context?
