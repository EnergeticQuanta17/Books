Automatic data collection and Feature Generation Techniques
	Not all of them are useful

	Chapter 3 and 4 --> Frequency based filtering and feature scaling as ways of pruning away uninformative features

PCA -> Model-Based Feature Engineering tehcniques
	Use the information from the data

	PCA is defined around the principal axes of the data.

	From here on, there is no clear-cut line between data, features and models.
	This is exactly where the excitement lies in current research on feature engineering.
