"Be careful to check whether array operations actually perform vector operations when implementing on a computer"

New way to find "General Solution"
	1. Make it into Basic and Non-Basic
	2. Express all the non-basic column as a linear combination of the basic columns
	3. Then we get an equation in terms of c_i {the columns}
	4. Shift everything to one side to make it lambda_1 * the equation = 0 
	5. Now realize that if we add to x, this transformation does not affect b (which is Ax) because we are adding 0 AND due to vector addition-splitting property
	6. Hence basic solution + No. of non-basic lambdas of Linear Combinations

Minus-1 Trick
	OMG I CANT BELIEVE THIS

	Null-Space concept

	After finding the Row-Reduced-Echelon form
	Add rows such that all diagonal elements are non-zero
	The row number which u added, read out the column with that number --> becomes the lambda_vectors

	This works only because it is reduced
		as all the basis have value 1

	And non-basis will be -1

	In diagonal only 1 and -1

Moore-Penrose Pseudo Inverse
	Pre-multiply by the transpose of A
	Then Isolate x
	Whatever is premultiplied to b is the "Moore-Penrose Pseudo Inverse"

	The solution obtained corresponds to the minimum norm least-squares solution.

	Disadvantage:-
		Too many computations - matrix multiplication

		Also for numerical precision 

Linear Equations solving for very large system of equations
	Stationary iterative methods
		Richardson method
		The Jacobi method
		The Gauss-Seidel method
		The successive overrelaxation method
		Krylov subspace methods such as conjugate methods, generalized minimal residual or biconjugate methods

		x(k+1) = C * x(k) + d
			We do this iteratively for suitable C and d that reduces the residual error 2norm(x(k+1), x*)
				x* is optimal solution
