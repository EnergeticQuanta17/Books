Machine Learning
	Designing algorithms that can automatically extract valuable information from data

	Three concepts in code Machine Learning
		Data
		Model
		Learning

	The goal of machine learning is to design general-purpose methodologies to extract valuable patterns from data.
		Ideally without much domain specific expertise.

	We design models that are typically related to the process that generates the data, similar to the dataset we are given.

	Goal: Good models that generalize well to yet unseen data

	Leaning
		A way to automatically find patterns and structure in data by optimizing the parameters of the model.

Algorithms 
	-  as a predictor
	-  as a training

Model
	typically used to describe a process for generating data, similar to the dataset at hand.

We are interested in the model to perform well on unseen data.
	Generalizability

Main Concepts of Machine Learning
	1. We represent data as vectors
	2. We choose appropriate model, either using the probabilistic or optimization view
	3. We learn from available data by using numerical optimization methods with the aim that the model performs well on the data not used for training.
